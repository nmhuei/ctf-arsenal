Before beginning this section you should have completed at least the "Lattices" section above.
  
  
Throughout CryptoHack and especially in the RSA chapter, lattice reduction using LLL has proven to be a very powerful cryptanalysis tool. It excels at the related problems of finding short vectors in a lattice (SVP) and finding the closest vector to a point not in the lattice (CVP and BDD). LLL also finds surprising applications through Coppersmith's method.
  
  
However, lattice reduction algorithms for the Learning With Errors problem (LWE) only work up to a certain point. By making the lattice dimension or errors large, or providing a large/obfuscated basis, basis reduction will no longer return the shortest vector in the lattice. This is the intuition that makes LWE a "hard" problem suitable for cryptography.
  
  
What is the name of the computer scientist and mathematician who introduced the LWE problem in 2005?
