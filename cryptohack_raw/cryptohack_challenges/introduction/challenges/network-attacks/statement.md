Several of the challenges are dynamic and require you to talk to our challenge servers over the network. This allows you to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on people trying to communicate, or directly attack a vulnerable service. To keep things consistent, our interactive servers always send and receive JSON objects.
  
  
Such network communication can be made easy in Python with the
`pwntools`
module. This is not part of the Python standard library, so needs to be installed with pip using the command line
`pip install pwntools`
.
  
  
For this challenge, connect to
`socket.cryptohack.org`
on port
`11112`
. Send a JSON object with the key
`buy`
and value
`flag`
.
  
  


The example script below contains the beginnings of a solution for you to modify, and you can reuse it for later challenges.
