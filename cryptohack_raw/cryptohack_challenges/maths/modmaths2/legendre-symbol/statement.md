In Quadratic Residues we learnt what it means to take the square root modulo an integer. We also saw that taking a root isn't always possible.
  
  
In the previous case when

p

=

29

p = 29





p



=





29
, even the simplest method of calculating the square root was fast enough, but as

p

p





p
gets larger, this method becomes wildly unreasonable.
  
  
Lucky for us, we have a way to check whether an integer is a quadratic residue with a single calculation thanks to Legendre. In the following, we will assume we are working modulo a prime

p

p





p
.
  
  
Before looking at Legendre's symbol, let's take a brief detour to see an interesting property of quadratic (non-)residues.
  
  

Quadratic Residue \* Quadratic Residue = Quadratic Residue
  
Quadratic Residue \* Quadratic Non-residue = Quadratic Non-residue
  
Quadratic Non-residue \* Quadratic Non-residue = Quadratic Residue
  
  


Want an easy way to remember this? Replace "Quadratic Residue" with

+

1

+1





+

1
and "Quadratic Non-residue" with

−

1

-1





−

1
, all three results are the same!
  
  
So what's the trick? The
[Legendre Symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_symbol)
gives an efficient way to determine whether an integer is a quadratic residue modulo an odd prime

Now for the flag. Given the following 1024 bit prime and 10 integers, find the quadratic residue and then calculate its square root; the square root is your flag. Of the two possible roots, submit the larger one as your answer.
  
  


So Legendre's symbol tells us which integer is a quadratic residue, but how do we find the square root?! The prime supplied obeys

p = 3 \mod 4





p

mod

, which allows us easily compute the square root. The answer is online, but you can figure it out yourself if you think about Fermat's little theorem.
