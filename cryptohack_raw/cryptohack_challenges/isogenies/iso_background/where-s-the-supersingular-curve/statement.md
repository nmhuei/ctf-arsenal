For the majority of this category (and all challenges at the time of writing) we are interested in computing isogenies between supersingular curves. Cryptographically, we are interested in supersingular elliptic curves because the

neighbours) as well as Ramanujan graphs with optimal expansion properties. Essentially this means it is easy to get lost walking randomly around the graph, and hard isogeny problems are based on the fact that knowing the beginning and end of these walks is not enough to recover the path itself.
  
  


Mathematically, the name "supersingular" came from the fact that the endomorphism ring of these elliptic curves are "super-sized". They're not singular curves (all elliptic curves are non-singular!) but the "singularity" part of this comes from "special" (or rare) rather than singular in the geometric sense. In higher dimension we talk about superspecial abelian varieties and really this makes sense for elliptic curves too! These supersingular curves are very special and for very large characteristic, happening upon a supersingular curve is extremely unlikely (probability

For this challenge there is a list of curves to pick from — can you identify the supersingular elliptic curve? Unironically, the wikipedia resource below is a great start and we've also included some lecture notes by Andrew Sutherland which are a fantastic resource.
  
  
The flag is the Montgomery coefficient A of the supersingular elliptic curve in the list of curves provided.
