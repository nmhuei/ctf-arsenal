You are now ready to implement a full CSIDH key exchange! In the source file you are given a prime modulus, a starting curve

, an array of odd primes and two arrays of private keys with values between

The secret isogeny is computed by stepping "forward" with

is negative. Note that it doesn't matter which order you compute these steps (all the

are coprime) and it is the commutativity of these

-isogenies which you will compute which allows us to use these isogenies to build a non-interactive key exchange.
  
  
This means, given some exponent vector, a public key is set as the Montgomery coefficient A after computing the corresponding isogeny from

. If Alice and Bob compute their public keys and then compute the same isogeny (same exponent vector) from each others public curves, they effectively will have walked from

with an isogeny computed from the sum of their two secret exponent vectors. As addition is associative, so is CSIDH (there's a lot more to this fact) and the codomain of their second isogenies will match. Their shared secret is then the Montgomery coefficient of this final curve.
  
  
To get the flag, use the private keys provided to compute Alice and Bob's public keys. Send these keys between the two parties and then compute the shared secret. Use this to decrypt the flag and finish the section! Good Luck and well done with the hard work :)
