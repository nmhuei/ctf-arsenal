We have now shown that the Schnorr protocol for proving knowledge of a discrete logarithm relation is a

Σ

\Sigma





Σ
-Protocol! We did this by showing that it has the correct 3 move pattern, and satisfies the properties of Completeness, Special Soundness and SHVZK (Special Honest-Verifier Zero-Knowledge.)
  
  
While this took a little bit of work to prove, being a

Σ

\Sigma





Σ
-Protocol carries many nice advantages. For example, in this challenge we will explore how any

Σ

\Sigma





Σ
-Protocol can be made into a non-interaction zero knowledge proof (NIZK) essentially for free, using a generic transformation, first formalised by Fiat and Shamir!
  
  
Recall how SHVZK noted that for the honest verifier case, the only input the verifier has to the protocol is to supply a uniformly random

t

t





t
-bit string, after the prover has committed to an

a

a





a
value.
  
  
It follows that the receiver doesn't necessarily need to sample this randomness itself, as long as it is uniformly randomly sampled
after
the prover has committed to his

a

a





a
value. Luckily we have a primitive in cryptography which takes an input, and returns a (supposedly) uniformly random value based on that input: a hash function!
  
  
The observation of Fiat and Shamir was that we can replace the random value from the prover by the output of a hash function run on the first message of the protocol, and get the same security properties.
  
  
Note that this does allow the Prover to re-sample many

e

e





e
values very quickly by just brute forcing

a

a





a
values locally. However from the Special Soundness and SHVZK we know that for a given

a

a





a
, a Prover who does not know the witness

w

w





w
will only be able to answer at most one

e

e





e
with a valid

z

z





z
. This means each query to the hash function will have a

, so the chances of a (polynomial in the security parameter) bounded cheating prover forging a proof is negligible.
  
  


Note: the exact values put into the hash are very important here. In general you want to hash all the public inputs and first messages, and in more complicated protocols (and in CTFs) it is very common to see vulnerabilities based on Fiat-Shamir transforms where not the entire input was hashed, letting malicious provers modify parts of their initial message/public input data after computing

, and forging proofs in this way.
  
  


Unnecessary theory for those interested: The notion of a "Proof of Knowledge" (as formalised by Bellare and Goldreich in '92) is as follows: If there exists an extractor, which given black box access to an efficient Prover P, can efficiently extract a witness

w

w





w
, then P "knows"

w

w





w
.
  
  
For a special-sound sigma protocol, the following is an extractor (E) which can recover

w

w





w
given black-box rewinding access to P:
  
  

1. E receives

   a

   a





   a
   from P, sends some random

   e

   e





   e
   , and receives

   z

   z





   z
2. E then rewinds P back to it's state just after it sent

   a

   a





   a
3. E then resamples a random

   e

   ′

   e'






   e










   ′
   and sends that to P, and receives a

   z

   ′

   z'






   z










   ′
   from P.
4. E now has two satisfying transcripts

   (

   a

   ,

   e

   ,

   z

   )

   (a,e,z)





   (

   a

   ,



   e

   z

   )
   ,

   (

   a

   ,


   e

   ′

   ,


   z

   ′

   )

   (a,e',z')





   (

   a

   ,




   e










   ′

   ,




   z










   ′

   )
   where

   e

   ≠


   e

   ′

   e \neq e'





   e












   


   =






   e










   ′
   , so by special soundness can recover

   w

   w





   w

  
  
This rewinding technique is a standard way of showing that for some well defined prover, simply being able to rewind it to an earlier state is enough for it to leak

w

w





w
.
  
  
For Fiat Shamir, you may notice this extractor no longer works if

e

=

H

(

a

)

e=H(a)





e

(

is always the same. This is where cryptographers model hash functions as something called a
*Random Oracle*
(RO). RO's are an idealised version of a hash function, which upon receiving an input for the first time returns a uniformly random value, and notes down what it returned. If it receives the same message again it returns the same value as previously.
  
  
Fiat-Shamir NIZK's are typically proved secure in the Programmable Random Oracle model, where we give the extractor the ability to see queries to the RO and control the initial output of the RO. The extractor then observes when P calls RO(

a

a





a
), makes it return one random value, rewinds P and the RO back to before the query, and makes the RO return a different random value the second time.
  
  
These transformations (and their limitations) are generally assumed knowledge within the research community, and one of the strengths of constructions like

Σ

\Sigma





Σ
-Protocols is that showing your protocol is one is enough to let you handwave away the "nizk-ification" as "using Fiat Shamir in the RO model we get...". But for those interested in a formal treatment, see fx.

What is especially cool about this transformation (beside it making the protocol fully non interactive) is that it also removes all of the verifiers inputs from the protocol. This means that there is nothing a malicious verifier can actually do to try and break the protocol/diverge from what an honest verifier would do. So the fact that the sigma protocol is Honest Verifier Zero Knowledge, means this generic Fiat-Shamir transform also makes the protocol Zero-Knowledge even against malicious adversaries.
  
  
This has made this protocol a provably secure, efficient way of securely and non interactively proving knowledge of a secret DLOG relation, against potentially malicious verifiers.
  
  
In this challenge you'll construct a Fiat-Shamir NIZK proving knowledge of the DLOG relation.
