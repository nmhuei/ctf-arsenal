A Merkle tree is a fundamental concept in computer science, particularly utilized within blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to ensure data integrity and efficiency in verification processes. Imagine it as a tree structure, but instead of leaves and branches in the traditional sense, it consists of nodes containing hashes of data blocks.
  
  
At the very bottom of the tree, are the leaves, which are hashes of individual pieces of data (like transactions in the case of cryptocurrencies). These hashes are unique fingerprints of the data, created using cryptographic hash functions that turn any input into a fixed-size, indecipherable output. Moving up the tree, each leaf node is paired and hashed together to form the nodes of the next layer. This pairing and hashing continue upwards until you reach the single hash at the top of the tree, known as the Merkle root.

The beauty of the Merkle tree lies in its efficiency for verifying content. If you want to check if a specific piece of data is included in the set, you don't need to review the entire dataset. Instead, you only need to look at the hashes along the path from the specific item to the Merkle root. This significantly reduces the amount of data to be processed and verified, making Merkle trees useful for large datasets.
  
  
For this warmup challenge, you will be given a number of Merkle trees, each with four leaf nodes representing the hashes of the 4 data blocks, and each with a root node hash.

The SHA256 hash function will be used, and nodes will be paired by hashing the result of adding them together.
  
  
Each line in
`output.txt`
will represent a bit of the flag depending on whether the Merkle tree proof correctly verifies or not.
  
  
(1 if the proof is validated, 0 otherwise)
  
  
Concatenate all these bits and convert to ASCII to get the flag.
