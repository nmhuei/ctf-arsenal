Today is Jack's birthday, so he has designed his own cryptographic hash as a way to celebrate.
  
  
Reading up on the key components of hash functions, he's a little worried about the security of the
`JACK11`
hash.
  
  
Given any input data,
`JACK11`
has been designed to produce a deterministic bit array of length 11, which is sensitive to small changes using the avalanche effect.
  
  
Using
`JACK11`
, his secret has the hash value:
`JACK(secret) = 01011001101`
.
  
  
Given no other data of the
`JACK11`
hash algorithm, how many unique secrets would you expect to hash to have (on average) a 50% chance of a collision with Jack's secret?
