The set of integers modulo

N

N





N
, together with the operations of both addition and multiplication forms a ring

Z

. Fundamentally, this means that adding or multiplying any two elements in the set returns another element in the set.
  
  
When the modulus is prime:

N

=

p

N = p

p
, we are additionally guaranteed a multiplicative inverse of every element in the set, and so the ring is promoted to a field. In particular, we refer to this field as a finite field denoted

F

.
  
  
The Diffie-Hellman protocol works with elements of some finite field

, where the prime modulus is typically very large (thousands of bits), but for the following challenges we will keep numbers smaller for compactness.
