All operations in RSA involve
[modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation)
.
  
  
Modular exponentiation is an operation that is used extensively in cryptography and is normally written like:

2

10






m

o

d

17

2^{10} \mod 17






2










10







mod





17
  
  
You can think of this as raising some number to a certain power (

2

10

=

1024

2^{10} = 1024






2










10



=





1024
), and then taking the remainder of the division by some other number (

1024






m

o

d

17

=

4

1024 \mod 17 = 4





1024







mod





17



=





4
). In Python there's a built-in operator for performing this operation:
`pow(base, exponent, modulus)`
.
  
  
In RSA, modular exponentiation, together with the problem of prime factorisation, helps us to build a "
[trapdoor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapdoor_function)
". This is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, but hard to do in reverse unless you have the right information. It allows us to encrypt a message, and only the person with the key can perform the inverse operation to decrypt it.
