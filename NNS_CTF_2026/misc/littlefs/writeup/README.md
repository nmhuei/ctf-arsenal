## 📝 Challenge Overview

I found this device with a NOR flash to that just prints out the flag.
Unfortunately, I could not read the terminal output.

However, I was able to connect my logic analyser. That is a tool that can record the communication between different components in the device.
You can open the `.logicdata` file using Saleae Logic.
To make the recording, channel 0 was connected to MOSI, channel 1 to CS, channel 2 to SCK and channel 3 to MISO.
