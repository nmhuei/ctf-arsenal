## 📝 Description

New to reverse engineering? This beginner challenge is an introduction to
the Windows x64 calling convention and how arguments are passed in
registers.

The provided `x86-64` `.exe` decodes the flag successfully, yet it still
prints the wrong message. Somewhere between the decoder and `WriteFile`,
a perfectly good pointer ends up in the wrong place.

Open it in a debugger such as x64dbg or IDA Free and follow the final
function calls. Watch the value returned in `RAX`, then inspect how `RCX`,
`RDX`, `R8`, and `R9` are prepared before the output call.

Put the correct pointer into the register where `WriteFile` expects its
buffer. Repair it live in the debugger and step through the program again.
