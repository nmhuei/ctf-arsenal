## 📝 Description

New to reverse engineering? This beginner challenge is an introduction to
inspecting the memory of a running Linux program with a debugger.

The provided `x86-64` ELF asks you to guess a passphrase. The passphrase
is the flag, and this time it is never stored on disk and never passed to
a library function. The program maps a scratch page, builds the real
passphrase there, compares it against your guess with a loop of its own,
then zeroes the page and unmaps it before printing anything. `strings`,
`ltrace` and `strace` all come back empty.

We recommend using `pwndbg`, a GDB extension commonly used for pwn
challenges. Its `telescope` command can help you inspect the pointer and
the memory it points to before the program wipes it.
