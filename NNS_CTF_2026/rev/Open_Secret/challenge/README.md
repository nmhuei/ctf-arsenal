## 📝 Description

New to reverse engineering? This beginner challenge is an introduction to
tracing the system calls a Linux program makes.

The provided `x86-64` ELF wants a license file before it will do anything,
but it will not tell you which one. The path is not written down in the
binary either and running `strings` on it only gets you `no license`. The
program builds the path in memory first, and only then asks the kernel to
open it.

This one talks to the kernel directly, so a library call tracer has
nothing to show you. Run the program under a system call tracer such as
`strace` instead, watch the call that opens the file, and read the path
out of its arguments. Your goal is to create the file it is looking for
and run the program again.
